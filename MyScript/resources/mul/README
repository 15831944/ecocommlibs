Here are some additional resources that can be used to configure or to complete an existing engine configuration.

Concerning english_secondary resource, it is recommended to attach this resource to the engine to support the mixed recognition of your primary language with English words.

This resource exists in different versions. Which one to choose depends on your primary language:

- Attach "mul/mul-lk-english_secondary_2.res" if the primary language is Japanese, Korean or any of the supported Chinese variants.
- Attach "mul/mul-lk-english_secondary_3.res" if the primary language is Hindi.
- Attach "mul/mul-lk-english_secondary_1.res" otherwise.
- Do not attach any english_secondary resource if an English variant is already the primary language.
