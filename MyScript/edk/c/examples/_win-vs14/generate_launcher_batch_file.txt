This file does nothing by itself but is associated with a custom build step
that generates a launcher batch file
  "$(TargetDir)/$(TargetName).bat".
This batch file first sets up the PATH variable to include the directory where
the MyScript Engine DLL is located and then launches the target executable.
This is necessary for "Win32 * using import lib" configurations because when
using an import lib instead of the MyScriptEngine dlHelper the library must be
located somewhere on the executable search path.
