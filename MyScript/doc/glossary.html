For example in Latin based alphabets, a letter can have an upper-case and lower-case shape (“A”, “a”). In writing technology, this is an important concept because the use of different allographs is what distinguishes one person’s handwriting from another.</p> <p><strong>Alphabet Knowledge resource</strong><br> The type of resource that determines what sort of handwriting will be recognized. This can be isolated characters or cursive handwriting.</p> <p><strong>Archive</strong><br> A “all-in-one” resource file containing several resources. A good example is the [language+country_prefix]-lk-text.res file, which contains the global vocabulary of the language in question, a grammar resource and a third level (multiple word) syntax resource. An archive simplifies the use of common resources.</p> <h3 id="b">B</h3> <p><strong>Biclass</strong><br> Type of language model. Statistical language models count word occurrences and calculate probabilities. A biclass model calculates the probabilities of pairs of words occurring together (e.g “club” is more likely to follow “golf” than “dub”).</p> <p><strong>Bounding box</strong><br> Hypothetical box that represents the maximum dimensions of a shape or drawing object. It is used to define boundary limits and can help with placing features in a correct position (for example, within a field).</p> <p><strong>Boxed field</strong><br> Writing area on a form where a box represents the space intended for one character.</p> <h3 id="c">C</h3> <p><strong>Center of gravity</strong> <br> In handwriting recognition, this refers to a character’s median point determined by calculating the average of the points in the stroke range.</p> <p><strong>Comb</strong><br> Writing area on a form where a baseline and short vertical lines suggest where each character should be written.</p> <p><strong>Coordinate resolution</strong> <br> The resolution of a coordinate system is the smallest gap or the shortest line that can be represented.</p> <p><strong>Confidence score</strong><br> Rating, expressed numerically, that describes how confident the <code>recognizer</code> is that it has supplied the correct recognition result. There are two types of score in MyScript SDK, a resemblance score and a normalized recognition score, which rates the candidates within the top list (list of most likely candidates).</p> <p><strong>Cursive</strong><br> Handwriting style, also called “joined-up” or “running writing” or “natural writing”, in which letters may or may not be joined as you write.</p> <h2 id="def">DEF</h2> <h3 id="d">D</h3> <p><strong>Data format</strong> <br> Linguistic, syntactic, and semantic constraints of the handwritten information to be recognized by the <code>recognizer</code>. It could be described as the expected type of input. Your handwriting context’s data format may be textual, and could be recognized with the help of a lexicon, or it could be more specific, such as a date or time, in which case it could be defined in the form of a regular expression. MyScript SDK offers language-specific resources to assist in recognition of various data formats.</p> <p><strong>Diacritic (or diacritical mark)</strong> <br> Glyph added to a letter, usually to indicate a special phoentic value or distinguish words that are otehrwise graphically identical. Exemple: façade, résumé, Maimö, etc.</p> <p><strong>Digital ink</strong><br> A series of strokes following the trajectory of the user’s handwriting, entered using a pen or pointing device through pen interfaces such as a touch screen, digital pen, graphics tablet, interactive whiteboard, and so on.</p> <h3 id="e">E</h3> <h3 id="f">F</h3> <p><strong>Floating point</strong><br> Decimal point whose location is not fixed. In other words, the number of digits before and after this point is not fixed.</p> <p><strong>Form</strong><br> Structured document in which handwriting is constrained into specific areas, defined by combs or boxes or guide lines or similar, with specific content types (fields).</p> <h2 id="ghi">GHI</h2> <h3 id="g">G</h3> <p><strong>Gesture</strong><br> A very specific set of strokes designed to model a user-defined symbol for very specific applications. For example, MyScript supports the following gestures: space (left to right), backspace (right to left stroke), carriage return (top to bottom, then right to left stroke).</p> <p><strong>Glyph</strong><br> In typography, a glyph may be a single letter, an accent mark or a ligature. In information technology, a glyph is a graphic symbol that provides the look or shape for a character. It provides the visual representation of a character (but a character can potentially be represented by one or more glyphs). Two or more glyphs representing the same grapheme, either interchangeably or context-dependent, are called allographs.</p> <p><strong>Grapheme</strong><br> Minimal unit of a writing system, for example, a letter. Different glyphs can represent the same grapheme, which are called allographs. For example, the lower case “a” can be seen in two variants, with a hook at the top, and without.</p> <h3 id="h">H</h3> <p><strong>Handwriting context</strong><br> Base class for creating MyScript programming objects. From this are derived <code>recognizer</code> objects and <code>Indexer</code> objects for InkSearch. It is one of the foundation elements of the recognition process. This also tends to be used as a generic term to refer to a handwriting input area.</p> <p><strong>Hyphenation</strong><br> This refers to cutting a word with a hyphen (dash) when there is not enough space for it on a single line of text. MyScript SDK currently does not support hyphenation.</p> <h3 id="i">I</h3> <p><strong>Isolated characters</strong><br> Handwriting style in which characters are separated individually, in boxes for example.</p> <h2 id="jkl">JKL</h2> <h3 id="j">J</h3> <h3 id="k">K</h3> <h3 id="l">L</h3> <p><strong>Label</strong><br> This can have two meanings. It can be the expected digital text result for a recognized piece of digital ink, or the digital text that matches a piece of ink in pre-processing. For example during adaptation training, the label is the text that the ink samples represent.</p> <p><strong>Lexeme</strong><br> What most people typically call a word is actually part of a larger family known as lexemes. A lexeme is the fundamental element of a language’s lexicon. Lexemes may be simple words, phrasal and compound words and shortened forms. They have a meaning and fall into a specific syntactic category.</p> <p><strong>Lexicon</strong><br> Vocabulary list. It does contain words, typically, but it may also contain groups of words such as proper names, brand names, trademarks and other lexical expressions (which may include separators) that only make sense when they are kept together. A lexicon is a linguistic knowledge resource.</p> <p><strong>Lexical unit</strong><br> Resource type used by MyScript Text. Defines a data format supplied by regular expressions. You could say that a regular expression is way to define the various parameters (types, identifiers, whitespace etc.) that make up the lexical unit. You will encounter this term in various places; for example, a .ludef file is a lexical unit definition file and the MkLU tool compiles lexical unit resources based on regular expressions.</p> <p><strong>Linguistic Knowledge resource (LK)</strong><br> The type of resource that helps the <code>recognizer</code> identify specific words or meaningful text elements such as dates or addresses (i.e. the data format of what you are recognizing). Linguistic knowledge resources can be defined as lexicons or as lexical units using regular expressions or as a combination of both (you can import lexicons into a regular expression-based resource).</p> <h2 id="mno">MNO</h2> <h3 id="m">M</h3> <p><strong>Monogram</strong><br> Type of language model, used in statistical language modelling. A monogram model determines probabilities of the existence of a single word, e.g there is a much higher probability of a word in an English text being “golf” than”golt”.</p> <h3 id="n">N</h3> <p><strong>Neural network</strong><br> System of interconnected processing units (“neurons”) whose design and functioning are inspired by biological neural systems like the human brain. A neural network “learns” from example, because its connections are adjusted on the basis of the patterns you have “taught”. It can give projections by drawing on the prior known examples. The MyScript engine uses a neural network to perform handwriting recognition.</p> <p><strong>Normalized recognition score</strong><br> Score given during the recognition result. It attributes a rating of how strongly a character or word can be “forced” to belong to one out of n given classifications.</p> <h3 id="o">O</h3> <p><strong>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</strong><br> This is a method used to recognize printed or non-editable text in an image-type file.written text by a computer. The scanned image is analyzed to identify characters and the result is translated into a character encoding system such as ASCII. OCR recognition methods use offline data, based on scanned images, while MyScript uses online dynamic writing data.</p> <p><strong>Offline data</strong><br> This refers to the type of data used in OCR text recognition technology. When you scan text for OCR, it is already written or printed; the way that text is entered (such as the pen strokes making up each letter) is not taken into account.</p> <p><strong>Online data</strong><br> The refers to the data input used for handwriting recognition technology. Unlike OCR technology, the way text is entered (e.g. with a digital pen) is all-important. These strokes and trajectories are the data used by the <code>recognizer</code>, rather than a bitmap image.</p> <h2 id="pqr">PQR</h2> <h3 id="p">P</h3> <p><strong>Pen or pointing device</strong><br> Input component that is able to capture digital ink, whatever the user’s handwriting, drawings, scribbles or other handwritten material.</p> <p><strong>Recognition result</strong><br> Also called the recognized text, this is the result of the handwriting recognition process. This engine produces special identifiers that are then mapped to a character set to produce a sequence of digital characters, i.e. machine-readable text which will be understood by any software application.</p> <h3 id="q">Q</h3> <h3 id="r">R</h3> <p><strong>Recognizer</strong><br> API object that is in charge of digital ink processing and recognition. There are different <code>recognizer</code> types depending on the input nature (text, math, music, shape).</p> <p><strong>Regular expression</strong><br> Expression using operators that specifies what characters to expect in an input unit and in which order. etc.</p> <p><strong>Rejection threshold</strong><br> Scale used for recognition scores. It is used to reject recognition results with a low recognition score. These results should thus be validated or processed manually.</p> <p><strong>Resemblance score</strong> <br> Score produced during the recognition result. It describes how strongly a character or word objectively fits into a pattern recognition classification.</p> <p><strong>Resource</strong><br> Files used by the <code>recognizer</code> to assist it in the recognition process, for example, the alphabet knowledge files, or the shape knowledge for shape recognition. This knowledge is compiled into a .res file format, ready to be attached to a <code>recognizer</code>.</p> <h2 id="stu">STU</h2> <h3 id="s">S</h3> <p><strong>Segmentation</strong><br> Process by which the <code>recognizer</code> breaks digital ink into ink ranges or units. This occurs at a text, word and character level.</p> <p><strong>Slant</strong><br> Although exaggeratedly slanted handwriting can affect recognition, MyScript now includes a feature that can correct a slant and ensure better handwriting recognition.</p> <p><strong>Stroke</strong><br> Trajectory the pen (or the finger) describes between touching the handwriting surface and being lifted again. A stroke is a sequence of 2D points acquired over time.</p> <p><strong>Subset Knowledge resource (SK)</strong><br> Type of resource that limits the group of characters that can be recognized. Generally this refers to an abridged character set, such as digit-only, uppercase-only etc.</p> <h3 id="t">T</h3> <p><strong>Top list</strong><br> List of items returned by the <code>recognizer</code> that have achieved the highest normalized recognition scores. This provides alternative recognition results.</p> <p><strong>Triclass</strong><br> Type of language model. Statistical language models count word occurrences and calculate probabilities. A triclass model calculates the probabilities of triplets of words occurring together (e.g “on the train” is more likely to occur than “on tree train”, even though all three words are “real” words).</p> <h3 id="u">U</h3> <p><strong>User area</strong><br> Term from Anoto technology. It refers to an area on a pattern page that is defined and named by the form designer and from which the application can get (and interpret) strokes.</p> <h2 id="vwx">VWX</h2> <h3 id="v">V</h3> <h3 id="w">W</h3> <h3 id="x">X</h3> <h2 id="yz">YZ</h2> <h3 id="y">Y</h3> <h3 id="z">Z</h3> </article> </div> <div class="col-md-3 col-md-pull-9"> <aside class="sidebar hidden-print" role="complementary"> <nav class="toc" role="navigation"> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#abc">ABC</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#a">A</a> </li> <li> <a href="#b">B</a> </li> <li> <a href="#c">C</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#def">DEF</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#d">D</a> </li> <li> <a href="#e">E</a> </li> <li> <a href="#f">F</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#ghi">GHI</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#g">G</a> </li> <li> <a href="#h">H</a> </li> <li> <a href="#i">I</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#jkl">JKL</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#j">J</a> </li> <li> <a href="#k">K</a> </li> <li> <a href="#l">L</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#mno">MNO</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#m">M</a> </li> <li> <a href="#n">N</a> </li> <li> <a href="#o">O</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#pqr">PQR</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#p">P</a> </li> <li> <a href="#q">Q</a> </li> <li> <a href="#r">R</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#stu">STU</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#s">S</a> </li> <li> <a href="#t">T</a> </li> <li> <a href="#u">U</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#vwx">VWX</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#v">V</a> </li> <li> <a href="#w">W</a> </li> <li> <a href="#x">X</a> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <a href="#yz">YZ</a> <ul class="nav"> <li> <a href="#y">Y</a> </li> <li> <a href="#z">Z</a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <a class="back-to-top" href="#top">Back to top</a> </nav> </aside> </div> </div> </main> <footer class="container footer"> <hr> <p>Copyright © 2017 MyScript&reg;.
