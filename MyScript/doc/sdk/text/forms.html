Text, each field of a form can use different parameters (different writing styles, different alphabet subsets, recognize different language elements etc.). This naturally depends on the content you expect each field to have. This means that the first thing you have to do is to analyze clearly what data your form must collect and the most efficient ways to do this, with a view to handwriting recognition. You need to plan and test your forms before deploying them, to be sure that the way you are collecting data is the most suitable and effective.</p> <p>The most important global rule when building a form application is:</p> <p><strong>The more constraints imposed on the writer, the higher the recognition effectiveness.</strong></p> <p>Obviously these constraints will be experienced by the writers as they fill in the form. Constraints can be applied at three main levels:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>the handwriting style</strong><br> Depending on how the field appears, the writer will almost always use a specific handwriting style. You can use isolated characters or cursive writing style. To use iosolated characters style in a form, you must constrain the writer to enter each character in a box or similar delimited area. This style is the most restrictive one and therefore it ensures excellent recognition accuracy; this does not mean that you should not use any linguistic resources, because the <code>recognizer</code> still needs to use the language expert even if characters are supplied already segmented. Cursive style however, is the most natural one for the writer. There are, however, no constraints on character separation; this is why it is impossible to recognize cursive handwriting without using at least one linguistic knowledge (<a href="../text.html#linguistic-knowledge">LK</a>) resource.<br> If for some reason, you cannot attach a linguistic knowledge resource to a field, you will need to choose an isolated characters Alphabet Knowledge (<a href="../text.html#alphabet-knowledge">AK</a>) resource (the [language+country_prefix]-ak-iso.res file) and set up the field as a boxed field: you will not be able to use a cursive handwriting Alphabet Knowledge Resource without an LK resource.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>the field layout</strong><br> These restrictions refer mainly to two aspects: the level of detail assigned to the field and its size. More specific fields use resources more effectively. These resources are usually better targeted and provide more accurate results. For example, it is much more advantageous to use “Title”, “FirstName”, “LastName”, “MaidenName” and “MiddleName” fields, than to provide only a “Name” field. But you will need to develop more precise resources to match each field. On the other hand, if you have a resource that can recognize several fields (such as a city+zipcode resource), you should use correlated fields during recognition to make the most out of the “multi-field” resource. You can combine fields for recognition purposes and split them at a later moment if necessary (for example for storing field data in a database). An example of this would be a postal code field and a city field (these are provided by default for many languages in MyScript Text):</p> </li> </ul> <div class="image align-center"><figure><svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="329.19583" height="18.657345" id="svg2" version="1.1" viewbox="0 0 329.19583 18.657345"> <defs id="defs4"></defs> <metadata id="metadata7"> </metadata> <g id="layer1" transform="translate(-35.522923,-13.90625)"> <text xml:space="preserve" style="font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-stretch:normal;line-height:125%;letter-spacing:0px;word-spacing:0px;fill:#4d4d4d;fill-opacity:1;stroke:none;font-family:Vemana2000;-inkscape-font-specification:Vemana2000" x="34.345188" y="30.393673" id="text2985"><tspan id="tspan2987" x="34.345188" y="30.393673" style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-stretch:normal;fill:#4d4d4d;font-family:Sans;-inkscape-font-specification:Sans">Postcode</tspan></text> <text id="text2989" y="30.067501" x="198.45183" style="font-size:12px;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-stretch:normal;line-height:125%;letter-spacing:0px;word-spacing:0px;fill:#4d4d4d;fill-opacity:1;stroke:none;font-family:Vemana2000;-inkscape-font-specification:Vemana2000" xml:space="preserve"><tspan style="font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;font-stretch:normal;fill:#4d4d4d;font-family:Sans;-inkscape-font-specification:Sans" y="30.067501" x="198.45183" id="tspan2991">City</tspan></text> <path style="fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:1, 3;stroke-dashoffset:0" d="m 223.70563,30.063595 142.4315,0" id="path2993"></path> <rect style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0" id="rect3763" width="9.5964489" height="15.657365" x="93.944183" y="14.40623"></rect> <rect y="14.40623" x="105.94418" height="15.657365" width="9.5964489" id="rect3765" style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0"></rect> <rect style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0" id="rect3767" width="9.5964489" height="15.657365" x="117.94418" y="14.40623"></rect> <rect y="14.40623" x="129.94418" height="15.657365" width="9.5964489" id="rect3769" style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0"></rect> <rect style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0" id="rect3771" width="9.5964489" height="15.657365" x="149.94418" y="14.40623"></rect> <rect y="14.40623" x="161.94418" height="15.657365" width="9.5964489" id="rect3773" style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0"></rect> <rect style="opacity:0.75308646;fill:none;stroke:#ff0000;stroke-width:1;stroke-linecap:square;stroke-miterlimit:4;stroke-opacity:1;stroke-dasharray:none;stroke-dashoffset:0" id="rect3775" width="9.5964489" height="15.657365" x="173.94418" y="14.40623"></rect> </g></svg></figure></div> <p>Always make sure that you are familiar with what a given resource can recognize and use it accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Field size must match the potential size of resource entries</strong>. You cannot have a field of 5 characters if your lexicon entries are up to 10 characters long! And the opposite is true: if you need to recognize only a certain amount of characters, adjust the field length accordingly. There is a property for instances of a lexicon that can tell you the maximum word length within that lexicon (<code>MAX_WORD_LENGTH</code>); it may of course be more difficult to predict the length of a potential return from a regular expression-based resource.</p> <p>Perform appropriate data collection. You will of course improve your ability to lay out forms correctly by performing data collection to better determine writers’ habits in given circumstances: data collection helps you to see what the input possibilities are on a field, so you can see how your data formats need to be defined. Remember that MyScript’s support services can provide high level expertise in improving recognition accuracy in your solution.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>the expected field content</strong><br> You can also constrain the writer to enter only a certain type of data in a field (for example, a surname, a city name, a date, an ID code, etc.), in a certain order. In your <code>recognizer</code> object, you need to put these constraints in terms that the recognition engine can understand, by defining the syntax, or data format, you expect the field entry to have.</li> </ul> <p>For each field, there are several possible ways of defining a field’s data format: - you can restrict the character set recognized in that field, - you can use a linguistic resource to restrict recognition to certain words, names, compound words or syntaxes.</p> <p>Remember that MyScript Text offers the <a href="tools.html#myscript-language-resource-tool">MyScript Language Resource Tool</a> for defining your own custom resources.</p> <p>You can restrict the character set using a Subset Knowledge ( <a href="../text.html#subset-knowledge">SK</a>) resource. An SK resource defines which characters can be recognized by the MyScript engine. For example, if you know that your field can only contain numerals, you can attach a digits subset resource and the recognition engine will only consider that there are numbers in that field.</p> <p><strong>You can use linguistic knowledge resources</strong>. The data format of any handwriting context describes the possible characters that a field may contain and the order in which they may appear. For example, a date is usually written in a limited number of ways (1/1/01, 1-1-01, 1.1.01 and so on) and you can cater for this by using a “date” resource that can recognize a date if it follows one of a number of common syntaxes. The <code>recognizer</code> will look for the closest match between the handwritten item and the possibilities defined in the linguistic knowledge resource.</p> <h1 id="defining-boxed-fields">Defining boxed fields</h1> <p>When creating form-based applications, you will no doubt define the areas where the writer can make strokes. This page describes how you can send ink corresponding to boxed fields. We do not recommend the use of “combs” for handwriting recognition.</p> <p>Boxed fields are used to define a field whose characters you wish to separate from each other. The field contains a series of contiguous guide boxes. This prompts the writer to write each character in a separate box. On a programming level, these guide boxes help you to define the areas in which you will later assign the strokes that the writer has written.</p> <div class="image align-center"><figure><svg

stroke segmentation, because you tell the <code>recognizer</code> at which stroke each character starts. Recognition in boxed fields is done with isolated character recognition.</p> <p>The new input model includes a <code>CHAR</code> type of input unit, which you can use for boxed field recognition. To tell the <code>recognizer</code> that you are going to send strokes corresponding to a character inside a box, you have to start a new <code>CHAR</code> type input unit. Then send the strokes. Then stop the input unit. Do this for each character in your boxed field.</p> <p>As the writer will also probably see boxes printed on the form, you may want to give the <code>recognizer</code> the coordinates of the guide box that corresponds to the current character (<code>setGuideBox</code>). This helps the <code>recognizer</code> solve geographical discrepancies, such as telling an apostrophe from a comma, or a capital letter from a lowercase one, because of where they are placed within the box’s boundaries.</p> <p>Follow this pseudo code for setting up the recognizer:</p> <pre title="Pseudo code for setting up a boxed field recognizer"><code>create a structured input recognizer&#x000A;attach any linguistic knowledge resources you require&#x000A;&#x000A;for each guide box:&#x000A;&#x000A;start a CHAR input unit&#x000A;set the guide box characteristics (optional)&#x000A;set handwriting recommendations (if using several alphabet knowledge resources)&#x000A;send ink&#x000A;stop the input unit&#x000A;&#x000A;ask for recognition&#x000A;destroy the recognizer&#x000A;</code></pre> <h1 id="stroke-assignment">Stroke assignment</h1> <p>Stroke assignment is important because your end-user will not necessarily always write every section of each character in the well-defined box that appears on your form.

There is a way to compensate for such situations. There are several alternatives open to you: you can compensate by defining the stroke’s whereabouts in relation to its center of gravity or by taking into account a larger area than the printed box by using a bounding box. There are also issues to take into account if you used to working with Anoto user areas.</p> <h2 id="center-of-gravity">Center of Gravity</h2> <p>A stroke’s center of gravity is the major criterion you will use in determining whether or not a stroke “belongs” to a given box. It will indicate the pivotal point of that stroke, and there is a good chance that this point will be located in a given writing area, even if the extremities of the ink stroke are not.</p> <p>Here we

field box (F) within a bounding box (B) that is larger than the box the user sees on the form. The user will fill in the F area, but you dispose of a larger area in which to take into account your strokes.</p> <p>In this example the stroke of the dot on the “i” is located outside the visible box of field F. Thanks to the virtual bounding box B being slightly larger than the field box, the dot on the “i” character is recovered and assigned to field F.</p> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>Do not be tempted to consider diacritics as simply details: they are important parts of the handwriting recognition process and should be recovered whenever possible.</div> <p>Depending on the results of the calculations described in the Center of Gravity section, if you determine that point G is located inside the virtual bounding box B, then stroke S can be assigned to field F.</p> <p>Below you can see some typical examples of fields F (red boxes) with their virtual bounding boxes B (green boxes); the comb field in this example is assumed to be made up of several independent fields.</p> <div class="image align-center"><figure><svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="318.38" height="121.91" id="svg2" version="1.1"

If we apply the rule concerning the center of gravity, the stroke corresponding to the letters “gr” will be assigned to B2 which is not correct in this case. Had we looked more closely at the strokes immediately before and after “gr”, we would have seen that they are all assigned to the field F1, which is a good indication that “gr” should also be assigned to F1.</p> <p>We can then conclude that if point G is located inside the virtual bounding box B2, but the adjacent strokes drawn just before or after it belong to another virtual bounding box B1 which has a common border with B2, then stroke S must be assigned to F1.</p> <p>If you have the appropriate MyScript support license, you can contact us if you need specific code to improve field assignment through stroke context.</p> <h2 id="anoto-user-areas">Anoto User Areas</h2> <p>In the Anoto SDK, user areas and associated methods are used to retrieve strokes. A user area is a defined, named area on a pattern page, and these are used as form fields in Anoto technology.</p> <p>To correctly retrieve strokes with the Anoto SDK, you should use PenStrokes to get the XY arrays. We recommend that you not use Anoto user areas for the purposes of handwriting recognition but retrieve strokes at page level.</p> <p>For handwriting recognition, you will achieve increased stroke assignment accuracy by first retrieving strokes for the entire page (at the drawing area level) and then reassigning them to each field, using the stroke assignment methods described earlier.</p> <h2 id="recommended-algorithm">Recommended Algorithm</h2> <p>Based on the solutions we have listed on this page, here is an algorithm that you can use for achieving correct stroke retrieval for handwriting recognition:</p> <ol> <li> <p>get Strokes for the ENTIRE PAGE (drawing area in the pad file) through the Anoto getPenStrokes method.</p> </li> <li> <p>Define a larger Bounding Box around the field if possible.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reassign them to each field through the center of gravity calculation</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the context of the stroke when fields are too close together.</p> </li> </ol> <h1 id="using-isolated-character-recognition">Using isolated character recognition</h1> <h2 id="optimizing-isolated-character-recognition">Optimizing isolated character recognition</h2> <p>Isolated character recognition is vital for the forms industry, as it can provide very low error rates. Because of this, MyScript Text provides a number of features designed to provide more flexible results in isolated character recognition.</p> <p>They affect the interaction between the <code>recognizer</code> and the attached linguistic knowledge resources, allowing you to decide how the <code>recognizer</code> should react when it encounters ink samples that do not exactly match the recognizable content described by the LK resources. They can also guarantee that you will obtain some result even if it is an out-of-lexicon result.</p> <p>Setting these properties correctly will allow you to implement a robust rejection function, by looking at the new result information, together with the “old school” scores. And without having to tune thresholds on application representative databases.</p> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>An explanatory document is available that gives guidelines for setting these properties. Please read it to discover what settings you should use according to the results you wish to obtain.</div> <p>Rules for casing and accentuation in Vocabulary objects such as lexicons have changed. These aspects can be important for good rejection. For information concerning this, please read the help files delivered with the <a href="tools.html#myscript-language-resource-tool">MyScript Language Resource Tool</a>.</p> <h2 id="glyph-distortion">Glyph distortion</h2> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>This applies to isolated character recognition only.</div> <p>A glyph is a graphic symbol that provides the look or shape for a character. In other words, a glyph provides the visual representation of a character (or the mark you write on paper to represent a certain character). The MyScript engine examines glyphs and tries to determine, by the shapes, loops, size etc, to which digital character they best correspond. Some glyphs are more alike than others and so the engine will choose the most likely match.</p> <p>You can set a glyph distortion tolerance. In other words, you can ask the engine to turn down a character candidate that does not have a strong enough probability. Using glyph distortion is a way of setting limits on the potential variability of characters. This is controlled by the <code>GLYPH_DISTORTION</code> property of the <code>recognizer</code>.</p> <p>This is a value between 0 and 254. 0 means that very little distortion is allowed: 254 means that maximum distortion is allowed. 255 is a special value (see below).</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A glyph distortion of 0 means that the ink must strongly “look like” a character for it to be recognized (i.e. character probability must be high).</p> </li> <li> <p>A glyph distortion of 254 means that the <code>recognizer</code> will consider characters that do not much resemble the ink sample, as long as they contribute to a result that occurs in the attached linguistic knowledge resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>A glyph distortion of 255 allows the <code>recognizer</code> to consider all of the characters in the attached Alphabet Knowledge resource for a potential match, with priority given to matching a result that occurs in the attached linguistic knowledge resources. At 255, there is no constraint placed. This is the default if no specific level is set.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Keep in mind that when you set a low glyph distortion allowance, close to 0, you impose a stricter form of decision making on the recognition engine, which means that in some cases you may not get a result but the results you do obtain are more reliable. It also means that the character expert in the MyScript engine may prematurely reject a glyph, and return a replacement character instead (of type U+FFFD), and flag this as “unknown” (although this will occur only in out-of-lexicon candidates).</p> <p>An explanatory document is available that gives guidelines for setting these properties. Please read it to discover what settings you should use according to the results you wish to obtain.</p> <h2 id="flags-related-to-isolated-character-results">Flags related to isolated character results</h2> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>This applies to isolated character recognition only.</div> <p>When you use the recognizer properties devoted to optimizing isolated character recognition results, namely the <code>GLYPH_DISTORTION</code>, <code>SPELLING_DISTORTION</code> and <code>ENABLE_OUT_OF_LEXICON</code> properties, special output flags are given in the result. When characters are substituted or considered as omitted or when out of lexicon matches are made, this will be reflected in the score, and you will raise a candidate flag on the candidate.</p> <p>Several types of flags exist:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>SUPERFLUOUS</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> contains at least one superfluous character.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>SUBSTITUTED</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> contains at least one substituted character.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>OMITTED</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> contains at least one omitted character.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>OUT_OF_LEXICON</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> does not correspond to a lexical match and has been chosen out-of-lexicon.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>UKNOWN</code></td> <td>The <code>recognizer</code> cannot match this to a known character so a replacement “unknown” character is supplied (Unicode character U+FFFD).</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>ERASED</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> contains text that has been corrected by an erasure phenomenon.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>EMPHASIZED</code></td> <td>The <code>candidate</code> has been emphasized, in other words, the writer writes over the top of the letter to make it stand out more clearly.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You also receive other output information, such as the recognition scores and the “spelling distortion ratio” (sdr): this is expressed as a percentage and refers to the volume of characters that have been affected in order to achieve a lexical match (characters that have been manipulated by the distortions).</p> <p>The clearest way to see this is in some examples. The settings used are listed for each example:</p> <p>1) <strong><code>OMITTED</code></strong><br> The word level candidate is “TRAFALGAR” but the “l” and “r” candidates have been flagged. The only way for the ink strokes “TRAFAGA” to be read as “TRAFALGAR” is to imagine that two of the letters have been omitted. It inserts “l” and “r” into the result but it does warn you, with an “omitted flag” on each.</p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Lexicon</td> <td>Contains the entries Trafalgar and Square</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Lexicon casing</td> <td>LEGACY</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Enable out of lexicon</td> <td>True</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Spelling distortion</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Glyph distortion</td> <td>50</td>

unknown character flag</figcaption></figure></div> <h2 id="spelling-distortion">Spelling distortion</h2> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>This applies to isolated character recognition only.</div> <p>The MyScript recognition engine works best when used with linguistic resources, such as a lexicon. It will attempt to match its recognition candidates with the allowed elements in its linguistic resources. The SPELLING_DISTORTION <code>recognizer</code> property affects the lexical attraction. The <code>recognizer</code> will go so far as to “invent” a character that is missing, or ignore a character that is present, in its quest to absolutely find a lexical match for the ink sample. A flag will appear in the result to warn you when these events have occurred. Use spelling distortion if you want to know when the writers have added or omitted characters in relation to the lexical entries involved.</p> <p>This is a value between 0 and 255: the strength of the property depends on the value you define. 0 means that no distortion is allowed, so no characters will be substituted or flagged as omitted: 255 means that maximum distortion is allowed, so substitutions are freely allowed. In practice however, there are 4 “key values” that you should use, 0, 50, 100 and 150 (if you use another value, it will be rounded to the nearest key value).</p> <p>The article related to isolated character result flags describes the output flags associated with the spelling distortion property and gives examples. To summarize, the flags associated with the spelling distortion are:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Flag</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>SUPERFLUOUS</code></td> <td>The candidate contains at least one superfluous character.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>SUBSTITUTED</code></td> <td>The candidate contains at least one substituted character.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>OMITTED</code></td> <td>The candidate contains at least one omitted character.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The output information also contains the spelling distortion ratio: it is expressed as a percentage and refers to the volume of characters that have been affected (as a percentage of the lexicon entry) in order to achieve a lexical match (characters that have been manipulated by the distortions).</p> <p>Caution: the glyph distortion must be enabled so that the language expert returns a substitution, instead of choosing an improbable candidate from the character expert. This feature is time consuming, and should be used with a small lexicon or with a limited regular expression: this means a regular expression with restrictive syntax which does not include the + or * characters. For instance the date and phone number resources are based on limited expression, whereas the email or number resources are based on very open regular expressions.</p> <h2 id="out-of-lexicon-management">Out of lexicon management</h2> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>This applies to isolated character recognition only.</div> <p>MyScript recognition engine works best when used with linguistic resources as said previously. However it also has the ability to find an “out of lexicon” match, which does not correspond to the entries present in the lexicon.</p> <p>This is now a property of the <code>recognizer</code> that you can enable or disable (<code>ENABLE_OUT_OF_LEXICON</code>). When it is enabled, the <code>recognizer</code> can suggest candidates that are not consistent with the attached Linguistic Knowledge resources, but these candidates will be flagged with an “out-of-lexicon” flag. When it is disabled, the <code>recognizer</code> will unfailingly choose a lexicon match (even if it is extremely unlikely) or will return “no recognition result”.</p> <p>When the <code>ENABLE_OUT_OF_LEXICON</code> property is turned on, in the result, two more candidates will appear, at the end of the list, after the other matches. The scores in this part are not comparable with the other scores. Note that, for an “out-of-lexicon” candidate to be the winning candidate, there must be no possible in-lexicon match.</p> <p>Because of this, many MyScript Text pre-defined resources have been modified: they no longer contain a preset out-of-lexicon capability. If you use resources with an out-of-lexicon capability in them, you will not get a correct result in isolated character recognition. A second copy of these resources now exists called “extended” (this is visible in the file name), indicating the resource that has a built-in out of lexicon (in other words, extended lexical) capability. You can use this when you wish to retain an out-of-lexicon capability in cursive recognition.</p> <h2 id="managing-correction-in-isolated-characters">Managing correction in isolated characters</h2> <p>For isolated characters (which means recognition carried out with the input unit as “char”), three correction situations can be taken into account by the <code>DigitalInkTagger</code>, and they must be performed as demonstrated below:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Insertion of characters immediately after a correction</strong></li> </ul> <div class="image align-center"><figure><svg

has joined together two characters that should be in separate boxes in a boxed field. In other words, the user has not respected the separation between two character input units by lifting the pen. This works in situations where the input contains several consecutive “char” input units, each with a guide box. Please note a missing pen lift cannot be detected if the input does not include the guide box definition. This incident is not taken into account during recognition. To treat it you can carry out cursive recognition, which may give a satisfactory result, or you may rework the ink.

enough), so they write over the top of the letter to make it stand out more clearly. . This works in situations where the input contains a “char” input unit. In Latin script, the recognition result may be reliable, however not in CJK, although for non-Latin languages, you will still be flagged that a writing incident of an “emphasized character” type has occurred. In either case, we recommend that you send for manual validation. It works only in the case where the same letter is written more boldly. It does not take into account a correction attempt (writing a different character over the original).</p> <p>To detect errors in isolated character mode, the input must contain the stroke order information (see <code>stroke_order</code> parameter, of <code>addStroke</code> function).</p> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>An Alphabet Knowledge resource must be attached. The isolated character (ISO) resources also take into account the correction objects.</div> <h2 id="optimizing-the-accuracy">Optimizing the accuracy</h2> <p>The more you narrow the parameters that the recognizer must take into account, the more likely you are to obtain a correct result. Recognizing isolated characters is “simpler” than recognizing cursive writing. In structured documents, such as forms, you must aim to produce fields that are:</p> <ul> <li>physically constrained, by using combs, or boxed fields, and providing clear instructions on how to fill them in (in capitals, block letters etc.). Use appropriate field lengths.</li> <li>carefully targeted: a Name field is a poor substitute for a combination of FirstName, MiddleInitial and LastName fields. Separating numerical and text data, for example, a street or building number from the street name, means you can restrict recognition to a certain type of character using a subset knowledge resource.</li> </ul> <h2 id="score-thresholds-and-error-rejection-curves">Score thresholds and error-rejection curves</h2> <p>Scores are provided to give you an appreciation of the recognizer object’s confidence in its decisions. Scores are also used to determine thresholds, so you can designate a cut-off point. A cut-off point is useful for customizing your recognition results, deciding what to “keep” and what to “discard”. In other words, this allows you to sort relevant results from irrelevant. Using score thresholds and error-rejection curves is ideal if you are doing automated data processing.</p> <h3 id="rejection">Rejection</h3> <p>The goal of rejection is <strong>identifying ink samples</strong> (also referred to as units) that may be <strong>incorrectly recognized</strong> and that either <strong>need manual validation</strong> or another type of post-processing.</p> <p>What you choose to reject depends on your application:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Rejection at text recognition level</strong><br> In some applications, you will want to reject at the highest level possible, namely at text recognition level. In this case you would select only the first candidate at that text level as your recognition result. In other words, the processing will be based on the first candidate scores only.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Rejection at character or word level</strong></p> </li> </ul> <p>In isolated character recognition, you may wish to reject individual characters. You can reject from character or word level. In that case, the rejection process will be based on the <code>candidate</code> scores from that corresponding level.</p> <h3 id="determining-rejection-thresholds">Determining rejection thresholds</h3> <p>To carry out rejection, you need to determine a rejection threshold for the <a href="#normalized-recognition-score">normalized recognition score</a> AND/OR the <a href="#ressemblance-score">resemblance score</a>. This threshold is the lowest score value that you are willing to accept from the recognizer. If the score is insufficient, the ink sample will be rejected.</p> <div class="alert alert-info"> <span class="icon-info2"></span>When you use both the normalized recognition score and the resemblance score, if one of these scores is below its associated threshold, the sample will be rejected.</div> <p>Too low or to high rejection threshold will impact your results:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>High rejection threshold</strong><br> A high rejection threshold may give you more chance of a correct result. But the disadvantages of too many rejected samples and nil results may outweigh the advantages of higher accuracy.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Low threshold value</strong><br> A threshold that is too low will result in incorrect results that are not “caught” by manual checking.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="error-rejection-curves">Error-rejection curves</h3> <p>Incorrectly recognized samples are accounted in the <em>error rate</em>. Samples that are rejected and not attributed a character category to are accounted in the <em>rejection rate</em>. A way of managing the compromise between error rates and rejection rates is to draw up an <em>error-rejection curve</em>. This is a curve that tells you what percentage of results you need to reject in order to achieve a certain error rate.</p> <p>The curve below, which is approximate, is based on an isolated character recognition using the normalized recognition score.
